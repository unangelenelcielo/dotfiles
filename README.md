Currently you need to have mate desktop environment installed before running install.sh or install these package:
* blueman-applet
* nm-applet
* mate-calc
* mate-screensaver
* caja
* mate-screenshot
* mate-power-manager
* mate-screensaver
* mate-notification-daemon

To-Do:
- [x] Scripts to auto install dependencies based on diffenrent distros
- [ ] More color schemes and scripts to change them, currently only nord is available
- [ ] Script to change font, currently iosevka is configured

Review and run first install_offline.sh and then install_online.sh
